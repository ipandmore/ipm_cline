For Editors
===========

To use the plugin on your site you have to add "IPM Cline" via the Content Wizard (Tab "Plugins"). With the following options you can customize the copyright lines according to your requirements:


- Merge all fields to a "oneliner" (No splitting by div-Elements):
  if selected, in the HTML output all content will be inside a single DIV element;
  otherwise the date and the custom text will be in separate DIV elements.

- Set "©" at beginning: if selected, there will be placed "©" before the date output, e.g. © 2013-2021

- Copyright start/Copyright end: here you can specify the date for the copyright date period

- Use "today" as copyright end (Overrides the field "Copyright end"): 
  if selected, the current date will be used as the end of the copyright period

- Date format (d-m-Y => 00-00-0000): here you can specify the date format,
  in most cases it will be only the year in the 4-digit format (Y)

- Copyright text: the text that will be displayed after the copyright date
